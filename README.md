## Summary
1. **Behavioral**
 1. **<a href="https://github.com/frgrz/DesignPatternCS/tree/master/DesignPatterns/Behavioral/Command">Command</a>**: Encapsulate a method call as an object containing all necessary information
 2. **<a href="https://github.com/frgrz/DesignPatternCS/tree/master/DesignPatterns/Behavioral/ChainOfResponsibility">Chain of Responsibility</a>**: Pass requests between command and processing objects within a chain of objects
 3. ~~**Interpreter**: Include language elements and evaluate sentences in a given language~~
 4. ~~**Iterator**: Give sequential access to elements in a collection~~
 5. ~~**Mediator**: Encapsulates and simplifies communication between objects~~
 6. **Memento**: Undo modifications and restore an object to its initial state
 7. ~~**Observer**: Notify dependent objects of state changes~~
 8. ~~**State**: Change object behavior depending on its state~~
 9. ~~**Strategy**: Encapsulate algorithms within a class and make them interchangeable~~
 10. ~~**Template** Method: Define an algorithm skeleton and delegate algorithm steps to subclasses so that they may be overridden~~
 11. ~~**Visitor**: Add new operations to classes without modifying them~~
2. **Creational**
 1. **Singleton**: Class with only one single possible instance
 2. **Prototype**: Clone or copy initialized instances
 3. **Abstract factory**: Create instances of classes belonging to different families
 4. **Factory Method**: Create instances of derived classes
 5. ~~**Builder**: Separate representation and object construction~~
3. **Structural**
 1. **Adapter**: Match interfaces of classes with different interfaces
 2. **Bridge**: Separate implementation and object interfaces
 3. ~~**Composite**: Simple and composite objects tree~~
 4. **Decorator**: Dynamically add responsibilities to objects
 5. **<a href="https://github.com/frgrz/DesignPatternCS/tree/master/DesignPatterns/Structural/Proxy">Facade</a>**: Class that represents subclasses and subsystems
 6. **<a href="https://github.com/frgrz/DesignPatternCS/tree/master/DesignPatterns/Structural/Flyweight">Flyweight</a>**: Minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects
 7. **<a href="https://github.com/frgrz/DesignPatternCS/tree/master/DesignPatterns/Structural/Proxy">Proxy</a>**: Object that represents another object
